https://mygit.th-deg.de/sr24201/librarythd\nProjectDescription\nThis project is about designing a website/app for Library of a university. This website has several facilities for guests and members. In the following, we list some of which:\n\nsearching books by guests and members.\nlogging in the Library app by its members and staffs.\nregistering in the Library by guests in order to become as a member.\nreserving a book and return it to the library.\nupgrading the membership to one of three states (Gold, Silver, Regular) by library's members to use special options of Library.\ndegrading a member's membership by staffs because of some problem that happens by the member.\ncontacting with staffs to inform the occured events or problems by members or guests.\nsending comments and opinion about books, media , and other facilities of library by members.\ninserting the information of new book in the Database by staffs.\nupdating the information of a book in the Database by staffs.\ndeleting the information of a book in the Database by staffs.\nediting user's detail by administrator\ndelete user access to the app by adminstrator\ncreating chat room for members and guests.\nchanging language (English and German).\n\nOur database collections are located in the LibraryDB folder.\nInstallation\nMicrosoft VS code for implementation of project is used\nThis is an Angular project created using Angular cli. Install Angular cli (one time) if you do not have it installed .\nFor install CLI, should run the following command\n\n\n\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\n\nThen, you should install project dependencies:\n\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nBackend (MongoDB) : \nIn order to run backend, should install Mongoose. For install Mongoose, you should run the following command\n\n\n\n\nnpm install mongoose\n\n\n\nThen, to load that configuration into your application, you ’ll need some packages. Install them by executing the following npm command in your terminal:\n\n\n\nnpm install express express-session @types/express @types/cors ts-node\n\n\n\nIn Node.js, you need to restart the process to make changes take effect. You can eliminate this extra step by using nodemon to restart the process automatically. You can install nodemon globally with npm:\n\n\n\nnpm install nodemon --global\n\n\n\n\nWebsocket \nws is a simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and server implementation. We used websocket service to create chat room.For install websocket, you should go to the directory in which websocket server is located. Then, run the foolowing command\n\n\n\n\nnpm install ws\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nWe used Compodoc for documantation. To install Compodoc, you need to run the following command\n\n\n\n\nnpm install -g @compodoc/compodoc\n\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\nFirst step, to run the site on localhost, you should go to the app folder and then run the following command\n\n  ng serveBy default the site will load in browser at http://localhost:4200/\n\nSecond step, you should run our backend. All Collections are found in LibraryDB folder in our project. You just should import them to a database, called Library, in the mongoDb. Then, you can open another terminal and go to the server-side directory by running the following command:\n\n  cd server-side After that, you should run nodmon. \n\nThird step, you should run Web Socket. Open new terminal and then run the following commands one by one:\n\n  cd server-side \n  cd src\n  ts-node webSCK.ts\nAt the end, if you want to see our Documentation, just you should run the following command:\n\n  compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s -w\nTo test our Library app, you can use:\nthe following username and password for User login:\nEmail:  aida.nikkhah@gmail.com\nPassword: schdkb7i6\n\n\nthe following username and password for administrator login:\nEmail:  s.y.rashida@gmail.com\nPassword:  866dfds\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsive design :\n \nmain page:\n \nUser Login page :\n \nUser Profile:\n \nAdmin Login page:\n\nadmin Profile page :\n \nChat page:\n\nContact page:\n\nEdit, Delete or Add a book :\n\nsearch book:\n\nRegister user:\n\nEdit, Delete or add a user by administrator:\n\nReserve Book by users:\n \nImplementation of the Requests\n\nUser Login pannel include requests to login to the app by members\nAdmin pannel in order to request to login to the app by administrators\nEvents include Adding, deleting, Updating Books in the library\nReservation pannel to reserve book and also return the borrowed book by users\nAdmin profile pannel is used by administrators to access to other users and also they have ability to edit users information, delete any user or even register a user. Admins also can request to add, delete, update book details.\nUser Profile pannel shows user information and ability to change their own info. Moreover, search, borrow and return books by users.\nChatroom pannel is used to send text messages to all defined users. Also, users and guests can have chat with support team by this pannel to explain their issue and take advise by support team.\n(- app.component.ts is used to handle all incomming requests and redirect them to the coresponding route. we also import all diffrent routs we defined for diffrent requests, create connection to database, and import express in this file\nroutes Modules : which include event.ts, user.ts files.\neach of these files are responsible to handle specific requests. we did this separation in order to have a well organized structure.)\n\n\nSearch Book pannel to search a special book by users in the database\n\nWork done\n\nSeyedeh Yasaman Rashida :\n\nBackend \nWebsocket for creating chat room.\nsearch book \nreserve and return book by members\nadd, edit, delete book by administartor\nadd, edit, delete users by administartor\ncontact users and guests with administrator\nCompodoc documentation\nsending email ( users and guests can send email to the main administrator of library and say about their issues)\nusecase diagram (Online Registeration, Book Reservation, Change Membership, Send Comment)\nwritting Stakeholders, [Stakeholders and Requests], [Request Requirement] and Log_in in WiKi\nSaira font\ncorporate identity of THD\nResponsive design\n\n\nAida Nikkhah Nasab :\n\nPersona (Guest-Member-Admin-Manager)\nuser login\nadmin login\nuser registeration\ninternationalization\nusecase diagram  (Search books- Report problems- Request Features)\nwriting README\nwritting Stakeholders, [Stakeholders and Requests] and [Request Requirement] in WiKi\n\n\n\nTechnologies\n\nAngular + typscript + HTML+ CSS + WebSocket client for frontend.\nNodeJS + MongoDB + Websocket server for backend \nwe use POSTMON and Thunder client to test our backend.\nwe installed MongoDB locally.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------The End-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
